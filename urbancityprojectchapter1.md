# Hope for becoming truly rich in an economic dystopia

Wealth today is usually measured in dollars. This only measures how much society is indebted to you or how much you owe society. This fails to take into account how much free time we have, the quality of our social lives, and the quality of the goods we consume. Everyone wants to be rich, but I will argue that we are actually very poor because we are working longer, making less, and consuming more junk as wages don't keep up with production. The 1% are getting richer, and the rest of us are poor. Technology and the world is changing faster than ever, and on the horizon are many movements and projects that have the potential to fundamentally change this around. But no one is talking about the big picture. This document aims to give you the bigger picture of being rich and some current movements that aim to tackle this problem so you will be armed with what you need to integrate this shift in technology and society into your own life.


# The refuge

Buddhism has an interesting idea called the triple gem. The triple gem is a refuge in this life. They are the sangha, the buddha, and the dharma. You can generalize this idea to three kinds of riches: kind people, time, and goods. If people have very little money, time, and bad products, then they would be considered poor in all three areas. The working poor is an example of this which is a state of adversity. This makes a very tough situation for them because they have no leverage in any area. On the other hand, kindness in the form of programs like food banks and basic income, automation, and simplified education and other goods along with decentralization that empowers people would set people free. This idea together would be a triple gem of the economy--an economic refuge. Now i'll go deeper into each of these.

# Kindness

## Poverty and the working poor

Poverty lines are defined in Canada as an individual who makes less than $22,133. But poverty need not be only measured in money. There are three types of wealth--support from people, time, and goods. People who have little money, time, and bad goods are the poorest in all these areas. The working poor are some of poorest among us because they are not only poor financially, they use up a lot of the time working as well. Some use their money on the cheapest least nutritious foods, parties, drugs, and distraction in the form of entertainment. In a situation like this, a person has to leverage every available resource to escape this vicious trap. If they are fortunate they have some degree of wealth or support in one of these areas, but without all three it takes more than hard work to escape. Then truly the only good way out is some kind of assistance.

in 2018 7% of people in alberta are making minimum wage. That's 1 in 14. In ontario, where it's the worst, it's at 17% which is 1 in 6.[source cbc][1] Working 40 hours a week at 13 dollars an hour that's $27,000 per year. At $11 dollars that's $22880.

4.8M are living in poverty earning less than 22,133 for individuals. That's roughly 1 in 8. One quarter are children, and many of them are the working poor.

In the State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report, it was estimated that at least 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness in a given year. [source homelesshub][3]

In 2015, the total median household income in Canada was approximately $70,300 before taxes ($61,300 after taxes), and $34,200 before taxes (just under $30,900 after taxes) for individuals.

## Low pay is systemic

Companies are better than employees at bargaining future employees to accept lower pay, except for positions that are in greater demand. A low wage worker will accept positions that pay just enough to support themselves when that is the only job they can find. When employees accept lower pay, the companies are given a competitive advantage by lowering the cost of production. This lowering of price encourages the growth of the company and encouragement for future low paid work. Companies who pay their employees more can't compete, so they don't grow to any significant size. This means there will always be a lot of work that is low paying.

## We need more kindness

[Income inequality][5] is out of control. Right now in america the top 20% own 90% of the wealth. If all the people with over 2 million net worth gave the rest of their money to the poorest, the bottom 60% would be well off. If the top %20 gave up just 24% of that wealth, the bottom 60% would all have a quarter of a million dollars net worth. The rich don't need all the extra money, and the poorest need it desperately. An economic system that allows such gross income inequality shouldn't be allowed to exist.

Not feeling safe and status prevent people from being kind.

We currently live in a competitive society. This makes people hoard and consume for status. Until our attitude fundamentally shifts from a win lose or lose win mentally to a win win mentally, the rich will continue to hoard their wealth.

If the rich are unwilling to give up their hoard, governments should at least be responsible to make people safe so people aren't living from paycheck to paycheck or starving. Universal basic income would be a way to to provide a safety net.

A lot of detractors of universal basic income say that this does not take people out of poverty, so we really need facilities. But i argue that this is not the intention of universal basic income. UBI is meant to provide a safety net so people aren't living paycheck to paycheck. It will allow people living from paycheck to paycheck to have the pressure taken off them. People in adversity and under risk who are starving or homeless will be given a home and the basic necessities. People who are under strong economic pressure living in paycheck to paycheck will be liberated and given the opportunity to floruish.It will also value work that doesn't typically have economic value like taking care of a sick family member or pursuing a passion.

The other argument is that people will just sit around and do nothing or have no life purpose. This is legitimate concern, but studies have shown that [people still stay engaged in employment][6]. UBI serves first of all as a safety net. It takes people at high risk and gives them safety, but it does not take people with adversity and gives them facilities or gives them a purpose. This is why facilities must also be accessible for people. Safety together with facility launches people into a state of growth. The section about production potential below and the section of simplification will enable people and give them the facilities they need to enter a state of creativity and personal growth.

[Andrew yang](https://www.yang2020.com/) is currently running for the 2020 presidential election. He is running on a platform for the freedom divided and using a human centered economy based on more meaningful mathematical predicators to improve our lives economically. He argues that donald trump won because the swing states are losing jobs to automation. Because technology is taking over, we will be able to pay for this with technology. If he gets elected or even shakes up things, this could have repercussions around the world. UBI's time may have come and this is the man to deliver it.

# Work less

## Economies create overconsumption and overwork

Everyone is demanded to work or starve, so markets continually have to be created to keep people employed, and consumers constantly have to want to buy people's goods to keep people employed. This makes a situation where everyone is working a lot and consuming a lot. Producing addictive low quality products are rewarded with profit and keep us consuming junk. For those that don't have a safety net and are desperate, they may turn to scams and crime. This is all turning civilization into societies of discontentment and long work hours. When you don't own the means of production, you are in a state where you constantly have to gain the debt of society to get basic necessities. This stresses people out and takes up all their free time in jobs that don't matter to them. People get sick and become unable to work. Some become neets and anti-workers and want nothing more to escape the system. But since they require the debt of society, they can't escape.

## Automate and only consume the essential.

Overconsumption and overwork can be solved by adopting low maintenance automation, consuming only what is essential, and simplifying production so that less tools are needed to produce a diverse range of products. Right now we are going through an automation revolution. [Construction 3d printers](https://www.aniwaa.com/house-3d-printer-construction/) are reducing labor costs for building homes. [Farm bot](https://farm.bot/) is an open source farming bot for your backyard. Truck drivers are being replaced, and we are on the verge of self driving cars. Solar panels continue to reduce in cost. And robots are continuing to replace workers. [42% of canadian jobs are at high risk][4] of being replaced by automation. There is a great opportunity to take back control over our lives, but we are also at risk of losing touch with production and companies controlling and owning this production. To ensure we don't lose touch, we must own and use these robots ourselves. We will need to keep in touch with advances in this area and produce and use home varieties of these robots.

Consuming only what is essentially is paramount so we reduce waste and reduce energy cost. Not consuming and not doing is often healthier and more stress free than doing something. When we have just what we need, and it's high quality we have less need to continue consuming.

# Simplify and Improve

## Businesses need to continually sell their products.

When products are produced they try to sell as much as possible. This means selling products that are lower in quality and high in quantity ensures that you'll come back for more and more. Updates are continually made and the latest greatest products are sold as innovating even when there's only minor details that are changed. Books are made long and trivial. If you can sell a series of books, you'll make a lot more profit. This creates a situation where the quality/quantity ratio is low.

## The high cost to purchase: an adversity chain

With our high cost of living the old advice of our parents is get a good education so you will be one of the lucky ones. People need food which costs money, you need a good job to make good money, so you need to go to education. Education costs money, so people who aren't fortunate enough to have financially well off parents need to get a minimum wage job or take out a student loan. Then it takes four years for a bachelor's degree to get a good job. You study long hard hours with complex information for 20 years of your life. But once you have that, then the job hunt begins, and with automation taking over, it's getting harder and harder to find a good fit. You'll be lucky if you find a good fit. So they think they need more education which puts them more in debt. They finally get a job, but they can only pay for rent because they need to pay off their student loans. This eats up more of their money. I call this an adversity chain because it's a chain that uses up a ton of resources. It creates lots of jobs, but it makes people poor and puts people in bad circumstances. This is also a trap.

## Only buy the essential. And simplify.

Money should be used as a method of exchange when we depend on a highly complex task to make life easier that can produce again and again, not for consumables like energy, food, and rent, that slowly drain our resources and keep us dependent.

It's in everyone's interest to be able to be skilled and produce the good we need. Removing the barriers to produce is a task that needs to be taken collectively by society. So taxes should be going to remove barriers. Simplifying complex systems will make us masters at more than one thing. It will allow us to buy only a few high quality resources that will enable us. It will remove huge barriers that currently exist in our society. It will make education several months instead of several years. It will make well beaten paths that people can adopt more easily. In short, it will make us more content and skillful.

To feel like we can spend the time to make these kind of products, we need to feel safe. We have to know that we won't go starving the next day because we're sinking so much time and research into a project. When we feel safe, we are more are more willing to takes risks and try new things. There's no rush to supply something that is second rate. We will take pride in offering something that is really needed rather than something that tries to addict people. The quality/quantity ratio will go up.

Universal basic income could set people free to invest in products the world really needs but take time, reflection, and continual improvement to come up with.

# Accessing Production potential

## Homes only eat up your resources

Homes provides a place where we can only consume. We prepare and consume just enough food to feed ourselves and our family--nothing more--, its a place where we consume distracting entertainment like games, tv, and internet, we buy expensive couches to lay idly on, we lay on beds to sleep, there are long commute times between work and home with vehicles that cost a fortune, it takes time and effort to clean and maintain. Houses are highly expensive.

Mortgages can cost $20,000 down payment along with $1,800 for a 30 year loan. Yearly the cost would be around $21,600. If you are lucky enough to have a partner, then one person could work to pay the house for 30 years, and the other person could pay for food, energy, and other necessities. The working individual can only afford to rent. Renting just goes to suck up peoples money.

If we do not work, we risk running out of money to buy food. Food is a consumable that we risk running out of. When we don't have enough money, food behind paywalls causes an adverse state of going without. Food banks and food stamps have to be depended upon to allow us to eat. Residential usually provides only a little gardening, and most people to make use of their spaces because they are too tired or not knowledgeable to make it happen. Depending too much on grocery stores just eats up our money and puts us at risk.

Likewise, other consumables like centralized electricity, gas, water, and waste management, keep us in a state of residential consumption and poverty.

All this uses up our time, money, and produces no goods we can trade with. Residential just gives us a place to rest and feed for another day of work. Residential traps us into a state of consumption. Centralized production are owned by a few, and residential makes us slaves to this production. We all must find jobs to sustain our expensive residential lifestyles. And the barriers of money for things we consume keep us working long hours to pay.

## Structures of the future will be dirt cheap

Prefab homes, tiny houses, and construction 3d printers are making homes cheaper than ever before. Construction 3d printers are now building homes for $4k-20k. This could liberate us like never before. Instead of getting an expensive mortgage, we can buy a cheap home, and use the rest of our money to have our own production potential.

## Increase productive potential

There should be an abundance of decentralized simple productive potential. This potential will ensure that we get what we need without having to rely on money. Because everyone will own the means to produce, people are more likely to be kind and help a neighbour with the basics if the neighbour is disadvantaged.

This will also set things free that should be free, like information, because we don't depend on it for basic necessities. Prices for the basics like food and energy will reduce even further because they're so easy to access.

Owning production potential depends on how easily you can access it. If you own it in your own home, it will be the easiest to access. Closer to this if you can access it in walking distance in your community for low cost, it makes it easy. And even less so if there is only one place to access it in the country and you do not own it.

We need to create a movement of production potential rooted in ownership and close access.

[Fab labs](https://www.fablabs.io/) and makerspaces are bringing production potential to communities all over the world. It's a grassroots movement that is creating anywhere from smaller fab labs to more expensive research fab labs.

The fab lab program researching and is working on developing a production system that can produce anything like the digital world produces information. The four properties of digital information are reliability, modularity, locality, and reversibility. They are working so that in the next ten to twenty years will produce some kind of replicator that can produce just about anything like we do now for digital information. If this comes true we could be producing just about anything in our living rooms and our basements.

Solar panels, farmbots, and computers are making homes places where we can actually produce what we need.

## Reimagine cities.

There are 11 basic areas that revolve around a whole human
- communities
- information and environment
- sleep
- food and air
- sex
- waste
- transportation and fitness
- clothes and skin
- energy and materials
- cleaning
- tools

Cities are designed around transportation currently. Transportation is only one aspect of being human. Cities neglect the whole human by providing access only to products behind paywalls instead of access to production potential and reusable goods. More holistic cities will better take care of people. We need to reimagine cities so that density of population for travel is balanced with access to production potential in our homes and our communities. We have to understanded why zoning laws are in place while still making better use of access close to home so our homes aren't just vehicles of consumption and wageslavery.

Providing an environment where we have free or close to free access to all of these things would take care of people as complete human beings rather than consumers and workers to make profit from. Homes and communities need to stop being so heavy on consumption and profit and become an oasis of wealth, production, and giving. Producing food has to be biointensive so that cities of the future wouldn't be so spread out as to impair transportation. Think biointensive urban farming. Think solar panels. Think decentralized production.

# The cause

The cause of all of all these problems can be summed up by three problems--paywalls, poor purchases, and the division of labour.

Paywalls keep people in adverse circumstances. If you do not have enough money to thrive and buy a way out, then you are thrust into poverty. Not feeling safe makes our health suffer, promotes scams, crime, and addictive products.

As division of labour increases productivity increases. This is the argument for specialization. But division of labour is also inversely proportional to value which both together create discontent. So as specialization increases the more products exist that we want. Also as specialization increases so does complexity. The more complex something is the more energy is takes up. This uses up our time developing a profession. Specialization along with paywalls thrusts us into a serious competitive condition that ever force new markets to emerge. This is good for having a diverse range of goods, but it also breeds discontent and keeps us working and feeling empty. A balance needs to be met between productivity and contentment. Right now we are tipped way too far toward discontentment and productivity.

There are four types of products--consumables, reusables, copyables, and waste.

Consumables are things like food, energy, and water. Spending too much money to buy consumable uses up our resources and wealth.

Reusable on the other hand, like an orange tree, solar panels, rain barrels, and other methods of production can be used time and time again to keep adding to our wealth. Using money to buy complex hard to make reusables is a great investment for the future.

Information are Copyables. In a wealthy and safe society where people didn't fear starving or going poor, there would be more reason to give away information for free. Copy-ables are so cheap that they are virtually free. They can be copied so their supply is nearly infinite which should reduce the cost to free.

But since people are not safe, people insist on putting good information that could help others behind paywalls and ruining people's lives by suing for merely sharing. Likewise bad information is constantly being produced and people waste money buying poor quality information. What costs is the production of these goods, not the distribution. But there is no distinction between these two when we go and pay for a piece of information. Because people aren't safe they produce whatever information they can, not necessarily what people really need. This uses up peoples' time and money needlessly.

Cities are designed for transportation not human beings. Cities pack as many people together as possible with the highest density in downtown. The serves to connect people, but it doesn't serve to treat people like a complete human with all their basic needs. People need good wisdom and knowledge, good sleep, clean air, food, water, romantic companionship, waste treatment, exercise, rest, clothes, shelter, and energy. When cities divide us from what we need by putting products behind paywalls that depend on others and keeping consuming instead of reusing and producing, we go into a state of unbalanced debt and payment. We need to create cities that keep us connected to all our needs as much as possible without depending on others as much.

# What's your role in this?

As you've seen there are movements happening today that are bringing a fundamental shift to how we do things economically. We need to join in and support this shift to make this vision reality. Through kindness, simplified goods, automation, and smart consumption, and increasing access to production potential, people will be liberated from the problems of the current economy.

There is a model I came across that goes through the stages of competence when a shock or disruption happens. Helping people adjust is the key factor that has to happen to promote this better world.

There are stages
- shock. something disrupts
- denial. you don't acknowledge the disruption and continue making mistakes. perceived competence is at it's highest.
- awareness. you realize it's there. perceived competence lowers
- acceptance. you accept that you have to do something about it. perceived competence is at its lowest
- experimentation. competence goes up
- understanding. competence goes up
- integration. competence goes up and you have adapted.

If people are aware of our current economic flaws and experiment to adopt a better way of life, we can develop a more balanced lifestyle.

I don't want to just sit around and wait while this change happens. Things could spiral out of control or we may miss something if we don't all take part in this change.

What role would you like to play?

# My vision

I am raising awareness about this cause because i've seen the big picture in how these different movements could play on each other for something that is much greater than the sum of it's parts.
See [reddit community.](https://www.reddit.com/r/decentralizedeconomy/) for resources. I am also interested in experimenting and simplifying the process so that people can adopt aspects of this way of life now.

It is becoming easier to find a small plot of land, buying a cheap 4k 3d printed home, and then using the rest of your money to automate production of food energy and other resources. This will save money, free up time, and with simplification could make it really easy to do.

Increasing production potential enough will allow surplus to be sold for money, and the money will be used to buy things that produce that are far too complex or difficult to produce ourselves.

Supporting the freedom divided and pools of money to create a safety net will ensure people don't fall into economic hardship. The safety net will help people in need ready for a change to adopt this lifestyle.

## Supporting the disadvantaged

The working poor is less able to adopt this lifestyle because they may not be aware or have the resources to learn.

How can we best put to use our current resources and free time?

To help the disadvantaged, i'd like to keep the initial startup costs low. These people want out more than anyone so providing them a path would be fantastic. 

More than anything i’m interested in finding a way to simplify complex processes to empower people to see a path out of their current economic crisis through education, technological understanding, and endeavors like UBI and kindness.

## Develop community

The most important thing is not to make money or to adopt all this new technology. The most important aspect is that a group of people become aware of this shift coming and to start experimenting and adopting a different economic way of life. One person in the middle of nowhere who adopts all this technology is great for him, but we won't see the fundamental shift happen in society if there isn't mass adoption and integration.

## The challenge

The challenge is can i help introduce systems that empower people in their lives.

Possibilities could be create a cheap urban homestead that doesn't wear me down and stress me out or use up all of my time, use money so frugally that someone who is working poor could afford it. The challenge is to create an alternative city life that people can adopt to get out of poverty and that makes us richer in time, money, community, and goods.

I live a pretty comfortable life now. I'm horrible at making money and feel insecure in my situation. I have a lot of time to research, but i also suffer from chronic pain and mental health issues. I've suffered from pain and tension throughout my entire adult life, and i have very low energy. So it will have to be easy to pull off physically.

I have enough money saved to try to do this if i'm very frugal. But i'm not rich by any means, so i will have to manage my money carefully and be realistic about how much poor people have to spend.

I also have enough smarts and determination to keep at things that are important enough and inspire me. So i need to continue to be inspired by this project to take the next step. I feel this cause is so important to society and my own financial well being that i'm more likely to return to this project again and again. But i need to keep trying. I know if i lose my motivation i'm done for so this could be potentially a huge stumbling point. I need small repeatable tasks that i can iterative improvements upon that i find rewarding.

I'm really good at simplifying. I have a lot going for me that allows me the chance to use my time to experiment and figure things out that could pave a simplified path for others.

I'm not the best communicator, so i will have to keep modifying what i write until something polished develops. If i don't get the idea across well enough, the whole thing is done for.

Is this feasible? Am i getting in over my head? Only time will tell.

I want to start small. I live in canada so we have cold winters, so researching and creating a small greenhouse in the back yard with a farmbot may be a good place to start, along with researching and continuing to raise awareness.

Eventually this may lead into buying land and building a cheap 3d printed house.

Right now inspiration and motivation is high, so i'm starting with the following books to begin my research:

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1494728745/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1603584269/ref=ox_sc_act_title_21?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1851687815/ref=ox_sc_act_title_20?smid=A23AYVMWTYS7N8&psc=1

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1603421386/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0997520833/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0399579184/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1

There are no books on 3d printing houses so i will also need to contact the company in canada who does that to see what they have to say.

I've also started a reddit group to discuss ideas like this called r/decentralizedeconomy

Hope to have you with me.


# Math

* How much money could the poor have to spend?

11 dollars minimum wage 35 hours 52 weeks
20000

1000 dollars a month 2 bed basement
646 per month shared accommodation
So 500-646. From rentfaster.

7752 rent
70 840 cell
106 1272 bus pass
2520 food 7 dollars a day
300 clothes
= 12684 total spent

7000 savings per year

5 years saving up 35000
so see how much i can do for 35000

$30*10 books = $300

* How much free time does the working poor have to spend?

168 hours in a week
168-40 hours working = 128
128-14 hours commute = 114
114-70 hours sleeping = 44 hours free time
44-14 hours resting and eating = 30 hours free time per week
roughly 4 hours per day of free time to invest in learning about

About 4 hours per day.
1440 hours per year to spend learning about a way out of their situation.

* What resources does someone in this situation need to get out that don't use too much of that money or time? Books or otherwise?

3 hours per 100 pages for slow reading.

15 hours per 500 page book

book/15 hours * 1440 hours = 96 books

All time won't be spent reading, but if we can reduce the number of books one has to read to about 10 max that would be a good chunk of simplified knowledge.

They need books and information that cover
- Biointensive urban subsistence farming
- Power production
- Home building
- Waste management
- Several books in their trade
- Community development and management
- A book detailing the problems and possible solutions for society
- Automation and 3d printing
- Math
- Directory of contacts
