## Poverty and the working poor

Poverty lines are defined in canada as an individual who makes less than $22,133. But poverty need not be only measured in money. There are three times of wealth--support from people, time, and goods. People who have little money, time, and bad goods are the poorest in all these areas. The working poor are some of poorest among us because they are not only poor financially, they use up a lot of the time working as well. Some use their money on the cheapest least nutritious foods, parties, drugs, and distraction in the form of entertainment. In a situation like this, a person has to leverage every available resource to escape this vicious trap. If they are fortunate they have some degree of wealth or support in one of these areas, but without all three it takes more than hard work to escape. Then truely the only good way out is some kind of assistance.

in 2018 7% of people in alberta are making minimum wage. That's 1 in 14. In ontario, where it's the worst, it's at 17% which is 1 in 6.[source cbc][1] Working 40 hours a week at 13 dollars an hour that's $27,000 per year. At $11 dollars that's $22880.

4.8M are living in poverty earning less than 22,133 for individuals. That's roughly 1 in 8. One quarter are children, and many of them are the working poor.

In the State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report, it was estimated that at least 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness in a given year.[source homelesshub][3]

In 2015, the total median household income in Canada was approximately $70,300 before taxes ($61,300 after taxes), and $34,200 before taxes (just under $30,900 after taxes) for individuals.

## Low pay is systemic

Companies are better than employees at bargaining future employees to accept lower pay, except for positions that are in greater demand. A low wage worker will accept positions that pay just enough to support themselves when that is the only job they can find. When employees accept lower pay, the companies are given a competitive advantage by lowering the cost of production. This lowering of price encourages the growth of the company and encouragement for future low paid work. Companies who pay their employees more can't compete, so they don't grow to any significant size. This means there will always be a lot of work that is low paying. There is no easy way to take people out of low paying jobs and poverty.

## Economies create overconsumption and overwork

Everyone is demanded to work or starve, so markets continually have to be created to keep people employed, and consumers constantly have to want to buy people's goods to keep people employed. This makes a situation where everyone is working a lot and consuming a lot. Produce addictive low quality products are rewarded with profit and keep us consuming junk. For those that don't have a safety net and are desperate, they may turn to scams and crime. This is all turning civiliation into socities of discontentment and long work hours. When you don't own the means of production, you are in a state where you consantly have to gain the debt of society to get basic neccesities.

## Residential and consumables are a trap.

Whole sections of the city is designated as residential. Instead of setting is free residential is actually a trap. 

Residential provides a place where we can only consume. We prepare and consume just enough food to feed ourselves and our family--nothing more--, its a place where we consume distracting entertainment like games, tv, and internet, we buy expensive couches to lay idly on, we lay on beds to sleep, there are long commute times between work and home with vehicles that cost a fortune, it takes time and effort to clean and maintain. Houses are highly expensive. 

Mortgages can cost $20,000 downpayment along with $1,800 for a 30 year loan. Yearly the cost would be around $21,600. If you are lucky enough to have a partner, then one person could work to pay the house for 30 years, and the other person could pay for food, energy, and other neccesities. The working individual can only afford to rent. Renting just goes to suck up peoples money.

If we do not work, we risk running out of money to buy food. Food is a consumable that we risk running out of. When we don't have enough money, food behind paywalls causes an adverse state of going without. Food banks and food stamps have to be depended upon to allow us to eat. Residential ussually provides only a little gardening, and most people to make use of their spaces because they are too tired or not knowledable to make it happen. Depending too much on grocery stores just eats up our money and puts us at risk.

Likewise, other consumables like centralized electricity, gas, water, and waste management, keep us in a state of residential consumption and poverty.

All this uses up our time, money, and produces no goods we can trade with. Residential just gives us a place to rest and feed for another day of work. Residential traps us into a state of consumption. Centralized production are owned by a few, and residential makes us slaves to this production. We all must find jobs to sustain our expensive residential lifestyles. And the barriers of money for things we consume keep us working long hours to pay.

## The adversity chain

With our high cost of living the old advice of our parents is get a good education so you will be one of the lucky ones. People need food which costs money, you need a good job to make good money, so you need to go to education. Education costs money, so people who aren't fortunate enough to have financially well off parents need to get a minimum wage job or take out a student loan. Then it takes four years for a bachelors degree to get a good job. You study long hard hours with complex information. But once you have that, then the job hunt begins, and with automation taking over, it's getting harder and harder to find a good fit. So they think they need more education which puts them more in debt. They finnally get a job, but they can only pay for rent because they need to pay off their student loans. This eats up more of their money. I call this an adversity chain because it's a chain that uses up a ton of resources. It creates lots of jobs, but it makes people poor and puts people in bad circumstances. This is also a trap.

## We're living in an economic dystopia

With so many people in poverty that isn't going to be solved any time soon, long work hours, overconsumption, low quality goods, large homes that eat up our wealth and traps at every turn, would you believe me if i said we're living in an economic dystopia?



# The cause

The cause of all of this can be summed up by three problems--paywalls, poor purchases, and the division of labour.

Paywalls keep people in adverse circumstances. If you do not have enough money to thrive and buy a way out, then you are thrust into poverty. Not feeling safe makes our health suffer, promotes scams, crime, and addictive products.

As division of labour increases productivity increases. This is the argument for specialization. But division of labour is also inversely proportional to value which both together create discontent. So as specialization increases the more products exist that we want. Also as specialization increases so does complexity. The more complex something is the more energy is takes up. This uses up our time developing a profession. Specialization along with paywalls thrusts us into a serious competitive condition that ever force new markets to emerge. This is good for having a diverse range of goods, but it also breeds discontent and keeps us working and feeling empty. A balance needs to be met between productivity and contentment. Right now we are tipped way too far toward discontentment and productivity.

There are four types of products--consumables, reusables, copyables, and waste. 

Consumables are things like food, energy, and water. Spending too much money to buy consumable uses up our resources and wealth. 

Resusable on the other hand, like an orange tree, solar panels, rain barrels, and other methods of production can be used time and time again to keep adding to our wealth. Using money to buy complex hard to make reusables is a great investment for the future. 

Information are Copyables. In a wealty and safe society where people didn't fear starving or going poor, there would be more reason to give away information for free. Copyables are so cheap that they are virtually free. They can be copied so their supply is nearly infinite which should reduce the cost to free.

But since people are not safe, people insist on putting good information that could help others behind paywalls and ruining people's lives by sueing for merely sharing. Likewise bad information is constantly being produced and people waste money buying poor quality information. What costs time is the production of these goods, not the distribution. But there is no distinction between these two when we go and pay for a piece of information. Because people aren't safe they produce whatever information they can, not neccesairly what people really need. This uses up peoples' time and money needlessly.

Cities are designed for transportation not human beings. Cities pack as many people together as possible with the highest density in down town. The serves to connect people, but it doesn't serve to treat people like a complete human with all their basic needs. People need good wisdom and knowledge, good sleep, clean air, food, water, romantic companionship, waste treatment, exercise, rest, clothes, shelter, and energy. When cities divide us from what we need by putting products behind paywalls that depend on others and keeping consuming instead of reusing and producing, we go into a state of unbalanced debt and payment. We need to create cities that keep us connected to all our needs as much as possible without depending on others as much.

# The Vision

What we need in society is to reduce time cost, reduce money cost, simplify, increase quality, health, low maintenance automation, kindness, safety, enabling by smart purchases, and decentralizing ownership of production.

The idea is to be aware of our current economic flaws and experiment to see if we can find a better way collectively. The idea is for so many people to see the value in a better alternative way of life, and face the problems together collectively and draw on each other's inspiration to propell us towards a better economic way of life.

The starting idea is to find a small plot of land close to the city and be the first of many to start an alternative urban way of life. Instead of buying a large residential home that enslaves us, buy a cheap one that costs 4k to 50k with construction 3d printers or prefab. This will free us from the plight of unproductive residential homes.

And then to use the rest of the money to produce consumable things like energy and food that typically eat up our money close to home. It will be attempted to produce these things without using up too much of our time. This will maximize our total wealth of money, time, and goods. We will buy things that are too complex to produce ourselves or use up too much time-- things like robos, automation, and time consuming crops.

Producing food has to be biointensive so that cities of the future wouldn't be so spread out as to impair transportation. Production will be simplified and automated as much as possible to reduce human energy costs so we can diversify. We'll all own our own production potential, and there will be people raising awareness, people teaching, tending to production, or some combination of the three.

Surplus will be sold for money, and the money will be used to buy things that produce that are far too complex or difficult to produce ourselves. Also a pool of money may be created to create a basic safety net so that no one has to worry about starving. The safety net will also help people in need ready for a change to adopt this lifestyle. It would also be smart to advocate for a safety net from government for all of the economy.

The initial startup costs will be kept down so that people are able to adopt this lifestyle. People will be more self sufficient, so they'll be more willing to help struggling newcomers for free. And it will benefit all of us if newcomers are successful because it will fundamentally change the way we do economics to a safer more enabling system. All the details will be simplified and made as efficient as possible and shared to keep it easy for newcomers to adopt. Also everything will be shared and social meetups developed to help create a community around this idea.

The most important thing in this idea isn't to simplify or make money or become self sufficient. Sure, all those things are neccesary to see a change. The most important thing is for a community to develop and we experiment and learn from each others progress. It only matters for one lucky individual in the middle of no where if one person figures this problem out. But one person isn't going to change the economy. He will die and the economy will continue to be dysfunctional for future generations.

Now i will go into a bit more detail about what this means.

## Work less not more

Instead of everyone creating more jobs and more work hours, we should be reducing the number of jobs people have to do. And we need to share the work, so everyone is working less total. Low maintence processes should be chosen whenever possible so time cost is reduced. 

## Use money carefully and only when needed. And simplify.

Money should be used as a method of exchange when we depend on a highly complex task to make life easier that can produce again and again, not for consumables like energy, food, and rent, that slowly drain our resources and keep us dependent. Simplifying complex systems will make us masters at more than one thing. It will reduce the time to proficiency. It will make education several months instead of several years. It will make well beaten paths that people can adopt more easily. In short, it will make us more content.

## Mitigate risks of paywalls to promote kindness and quality

There should be a safety net to reduce the risks of putting goods behind paywalls to catch people who are affected by our current poverty. Because this safety net exists, people will more likely spend lots of time to release something of higher quality, rather than producing as much as they can to sell. 

As risks reduce people will spend more time making quality goods, because there will be less incentive to keep churning out products to sell ever more. The quality/quantity ratio will go up. And we will only be consuming the bare minimum that we need, and the bare minimum should be the best quality to reduce the impact on the environment. We will take pride in offering something that is really needed rather than something that trys to addict people.

## Increase productive potential

There should be an abundance of decentralized simple productive potential. This potential will ensure that we get what we need without having to rely on money. Because everyone will have this potential, people are more likely to be kind and help a neighbour with the basics if the neighbour is disadvantaged. This will also set things free that should be free, like information, because we don't depend on it for basic neccessities. Prices for the basics will reduce even further because they're so easy to access. Money will be spent on those complex processes that simplify this productive potential. 

## Reimagine the economy. Reimagine cities.

Cities are designed around transportation currently. Transportation is only one aspect of being human. Cities neglecct the whole human. More holistic cities will better take care of people. We need to reimagine cities so that density of population for travel is balanced with direct access to land for urban farming and homesteading. We need to be more diverse in skillsets for basic consumable neccesities--food, water, energy, waste management, and money. We need to reimagine the information we consume to simplify so that the barrier to entry for complex tasks are reduced, so we can gain access to a modest amount of complex goods that maintain and produce, like solar panels, 3d printers, robots, and inexpensive 3d printed homes. We need close access to everything we could want to reduce commute times and energy expenditure. Homes need to stop being so heavy on consumption and become little oasises of wealth and giving.

## This may only be possible today

We are still living with the effects of old technology and old ideas. We have built an infrastructure that isn't serving us anymore. Today you can build a home with a construction 3d printer for as low as $4000 for a one bedroom house. And $20000 for a larger house. Solar panels continue to get cheaper. Farming technology is increases. Robots are getting better to reduce our time. Information could be free today if producers didn't feel threatened.

# The challenge

The challenge is can i create an urban homestead that doesn't wear me down and stress me out or use up all of my time, use money so frugally that someone who is working poor could afford it, creating as much production potential as possible in the simplest way, be kind by paving the way for others by and making it as simple as it should be to provide hope and get out of this economic dystopia, and releasing frequently to encourge a community of people sharing and helping each other succeed. The challenge is to create an alternative city life that people can adopt to get out of poverty and that makes us richer in time, money, community, and goods.

I live a pretty comfortable life now. I'm horrible at making money and feel insecure in my situation. I have a lot of time to research, but i also suffer from chronic pain and mental health issues. I've suffered from pain and tension throughout my entire adult life, and i have very low energy. So it will have to be easy to pull off physically. 

I have enough money saved to try to do this if i'm very frugal. But i'm not rich by any means, so i will have to manage my money carefully and be realistic about how much poor people have to spend.

I also have enough smarts and determination to keep at things that are important enough and inspire me. So i need to continue to be inspired by this project to take the next step. I feel this cause is so important to society and my own financial well being that i'm more likely to return to this project again and again. But i need to keep trying. I know if i lose my motivation i'm done for so this could be potentially a huge stumbling point. I need small repeatable tasks that i can iterative improvements upon that i find rewarding.

I'm really good at simplifying. I have a lot going for me that allows me the chance to use my time to experiment and figure things out that could pave a simplified path for others.

I'm not the best communicator, so i will have to keep modifying what i write until something polished develops. If i don't get the idea across well enough, the whole thing is done for.

Is this feasable? Am i getting in over my head? Only time will tell.

This is a rough outline of the steps and milestones i will have to complete.
1. Do the math. See if it's realistic. Read books. Do research
2. Share what i've learned.
3. Find cheap land near the city that i'm able to experiment on. Contact aids to sort out legal permits for land and building.
4. Share what i've learned.
5. Contact builders of greenhouses and construction 3d printers and see if i'm able to build.
6. Take a course.
7. Share what i've learned.
8. plan how i will grow food and produce basics.
9. buy land and build. I'm commited
10. Move in. And by now hopefully there will be some others who are interested in this idea and we can start sharing ideas.
11. Get help and use a plan to develop the land for farming and basic neccesities without stressing myself out too much. I need intensive farming practices to reach my goals in a small space that have reasonable energy costs.
12. Share what i've learned
13. Increase the production potential of the property in all sorts of things while maintaining the farm.
14. Learn new skills
15. Share what i've learned
16. Publish a book.
17. Consult with people to start their own urban homestead part time to hopefully get a community going in my area around this.
18. Onto next project.

Right now inspiration and motivation is high, so i'm starting with the following books to begin my research:

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0399579184/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1

There are no books on 3d printing houses so i will also need to contact the company in canada who does that to see what they have to say.

I've also started a reddit group to discuss ideas like this called r/decentralizedeconomy

Hope to have you with me.


# Math

* How much money could the poor have to spend?

11 dollars minimum wage 35 hours 52 weeks
20000

1000 dollars a month 2 bed basement
646 per month shared accomidation
So 500-646. From rentfaster.

7752 rent
70 840 cell
106 1272 bus pass
2520 food 7 dollars a day
300 clothes
= 12684 total spent

7000 savings per year

5 years saving up 35000
so see how much i can do for 35000

$30*10 books = $300

* How much free time does the working poor have to spend?

168 hours in a week
168-40 hours working = 128
128-14 hours commute = 114
114-70 hours sleeping = 44 hours free time
44-14 hours resting and eating = 30 hours free time per week
roughly 4 hours per day of free time to invest in learning about

About 4 hours per day.
1440 hours per year to spend learning about a way out of their situation.

* What resources does someone in this situation need to get out that don't use too much of that money or time? Books or otherwise?

3 hours per 100 pages for slow reading.

15 hours per 500 page book

book/15 hours * 1440 hours = 96 books

All time won't be spent reading, but if we can reduce the number of books one has to read to about 10 max that would be a good chunk of simplified knowledge.

They need books and information that cover
- Biointensive urban subsistance farming
- Power production
- Home building
- Waste management
- Several books in their trade
- Community development and management
- A book detailing the problems and possible solutions for society
- Automation and 3d printing
- Math
- Directory of contacts
